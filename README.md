## Cell 1: Importing Necessary Libraries

In this cell, we import necessary libraries for data manipulation and modeling, and we prepare the dataset for model training.

- **numpy (np)**: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for mathematical functions and operations on arrays, making it essential for numerical operations and array manipulation in machine learning tasks.

- **pandas (pd)**: Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrame and Series, which allow for easy handling of structured data. Pandas is commonly used for data preprocessing, exploration, and feature engineering in machine learning projects.

- **sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split**: This function from scikit-learn is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets. It helps in evaluating the model's performance on unseen data and preventing overfitting by providing a separate dataset for testing.

- **sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler**: The StandardScaler class from scikit-learn is used for standardizing features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. Standardization is a common preprocessing step in machine learning to ensure that all features have the same scale.

- **sklearn.svm**: Scikit-learn's support vector machine (SVM) module provides algorithms for classification and regression tasks. SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both linear and nonlinear classification tasks.

- **sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score**: The accuracy_score function from scikit-learn calculates the accuracy of the model predictions by comparing predicted labels with true labels. It is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of classification models and provides a simple measure of model accuracy.

## Cell 2: Loading of Data
This line of code reads the diabetes dataset from a CSV file named 'Parkinsson disease.csv' and stores it in a pandas DataFrame named 'parkinsons_data'. 

Pandas' `read_csv()` function is used to read the contents of the CSV file into a DataFrame. This function automatically detects the delimiter used in the file (usually a comma) and parses the data into rows and columns. The resulting DataFrame allows for easy manipulation and analysis of the dataset, making it a popular choice for working with structured data in Python.


## Cell 3: Data Exploration and Preprocessing

In this cell, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Parkinson's Disease dataset.

#### Data Overview

- **Printing the first 5 rows of the dataframe**: This allows us to visually inspect the structure and format of the dataset by displaying the initial rows. It helps in understanding the variables and identifying any potential issues or inconsistencies at the outset.

- **Number of rows and columns in the dataframe**: Obtaining the dimensions of the dataset provides information about its size and complexity. Understanding the number of rows and columns helps in estimating computational requirements and assessing the dataset's scope.

- **Getting more information about the dataset**: The info() method provides a concise summary of the dataset, including the data types of each column and the number of non-null values. It helps in identifying data types and potential data quality issues.

- **Checking for missing values in each column**: Missing values can impact the analysis and modeling process. By using the isnull().sum() method, we can identify columns with missing values and determine if imputation or removal of missing values is necessary.

- **Getting some statistical measures about the data**: The describe() method calculates summary statistics such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for numerical columns. It provides insights into the central tendencies and variability of the data.

#### Target Variable Analysis

- **Distribution of target Variable**: This step involves examining the distribution of the target variable ('status'), which indicates the presence or absence of Parkinson's disease. Understanding the class distribution is crucial for classification tasks and helps in assessing class imbalances.

- **Grouping the data based on the target variable**: By grouping the data based on the target variable, we can calculate the mean values of other variables for each class. This helps in understanding the relationship between the features and the target variable and identifying potential patterns or differences between the classes.

## Cell 4: Data Preparation

In this cell, we prepare the Parkinson's Disease dataset for model training.

#### Data Separation

- **Feature Selection**: We separate the dataset into features (X) and labels (Y). The features contain all columns except 'name' and 'status', which are dropped using the drop() method along the columns axis. This step ensures that the input features do not include non-predictive variables such as patient names, and the target variable 'status' is isolated for prediction.

- **Printing Features and Labels**: We print the features (X) and labels (Y) to verify the separation and ensure that the data is correctly partitioned.

#### Data Splitting

- **Training and Testing Set Split**: We split the dataset into training and testing sets using the train_test_split() function from scikit-learn. The testing set size is set to 20% of the total dataset, and a random state is specified for reproducibility. This step enables us to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

- **Printing Dimensions**: We print the dimensions (shape) of the features for the training and testing sets to verify that the data splitting was successful and to assess the sizes of the training and testing datasets. This helps ensure that the data is partitioned correctly and that the training set is large enough to train the model effectively.

## Cell 5: Data Standardization

#### Data Scaling

- **Standardization**: We instantiate a StandardScaler object, which will be used to standardize the features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. Standardization ensures that all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which can improve the performance of certain machine learning algorithms.

- **Fitting the Scaler**: We fit the StandardScaler to the training data (X_train). This computes the mean and standard deviation of each feature in the training set, which will be used for scaling.

- **Transforming Features**: We transform both the training and testing features using the fitted scaler. This scales each feature in the datasets based on the mean and standard deviation computed during the fitting step.

#### Printing Transformed Features

- **Printing Transformed Training Features**: We print the transformed training features (X_train) to verify that the standardization process was successful. This helps ensure that the features are correctly scaled and ready for model training.

### Cell 4: Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model Training and Prediction

In this cell, we train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with a linear kernel using the standardized training data and evaluate its performance on both training and testing datasets. Additionally, we use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

#### SVM Model Training

- **Model Initialization**: We initialize an SVM model with a linear kernel using the `svm.SVC(kernel='linear')` constructor. The linear kernel is chosen for its simplicity and interpretability.

- **Training with Training Data**: We train the SVM model using the standardized training features (`X_train`) and corresponding labels (`Y_train`) via the `fit()` method. This step involves finding the optimal decision boundary that separates the classes in the feature space.

#### Model Evaluation

- **Accuracy Score on Training Data**: We calculate the accuracy score of the trained model on the training dataset by comparing the predicted labels (`X_train_prediction`) with the true labels (`Y_train`) using the `accuracy_score()` function. This metric provides an indication of how well the model fits the training data.

- **Accuracy Score on Test Data**: Similarly, we compute the accuracy score of the model on the testing dataset (`X_test`, `Y_test`). This evaluates the model's generalization performance on unseen data.

#### Prediction on New Data

- **Prediction on New Data**: We demonstrate how to use the trained SVM model to predict whether a new data point corresponds to a person with Parkinson's disease or not. The input data is standardized using the same scaler fitted on the training data, and then the model predicts the label based on the standardized input.

- **Print Prediction**: We print the predicted label to indicate whether the person is predicted to have Parkinson's disease or not.

### Considerations

- SVMs are powerful algorithms for both classification and regression tasks, known for their effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and ability to handle complex datasets.

- The choice of kernel (e.g., linear, polynomial, radial basis function) can significantly impact the model's performance, and it should be selected based on the dataset's characteristics and computational considerations.

- Accuracy score is a common metric for evaluating classification models, but it may not provide a complete picture of model performance, especially in the presence of class imbalances or misclassification costs. Additional evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score can provide more insights into the model's performance.
